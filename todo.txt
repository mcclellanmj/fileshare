- Figure out expiration on shares
  - Fix the todos and find out how the datetime stuff works with sqlite
- Add security
- Add limit to size of response body I parse
- Clean up the email handling code
- JSON should be camelcased, probably means I need custom serializers
- Add handler for viewing shared folder, this will also need some kind of frontend
- Start making some tests
- Fix the unwraps, particularly in the is_child_of which can error out given any invalid path
- Find out if the Params function can be made to use &str instead of String
