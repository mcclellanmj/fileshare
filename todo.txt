- Change to a json based backend approach, remove the horrorshow templating
  - Removed horrorshow, need to add the json based services for sharing
- Merge the rendering folders and the handler folders together, that way the handler and what it renders is all together
  - Progress started with this
  - Should be easier now that its all json
- Cleanup filetools, probably don't need these splitup into different files
- Start making some tests
- Fix the unwraps, particularly in the is_child_of which can error out given any invalid path
- Find out if the Params function can be made to use &str instead of String
