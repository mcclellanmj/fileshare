- The places where options use ok_or are quite common, make a macro
- Add limit to size of response body I parse
- Fix the unwraps, particularly in the is_child_of which can error out given any invalid path
- The emailer service and other aspects should be configurable
- JSON should be camelcased, probably means I need custom serializers
- Start making some tests
- Find out if the Params function can be made to use &str instead of String
- Add handler for viewing shared folder, this will also need some kind of frontend

Check in a month:
- Using the sendmail transport for lettre, this required pulling straight from git.  This should be updated to use a released
version when its available.
