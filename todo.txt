- Get the view/download links working properly
- Figure out expiration on shares
- Add security
- Add limit to size of response body I parse
- Clean up the email handling code
- Make some sort of helper that will take all the statics and auto route them as well as allowing it to dynamically reload in debug builds
- JSON should be camelcased, probably means I need custom serializers
- Add handler for downloading shared file
- Add handler for viewing shared folder, this will also need some kind of frontend
- Start making some tests
- Fix the unwraps, particularly in the is_child_of which can error out given any invalid path
- Find out if the Params function can be made to use &str instead of String

Check in a month:
- Using the sendmail transport for lettre, this required pulling straight from git.  This should be updated to use a released
