- Need to move the database stuff out to another module to prevent main from getting too big
- Make function that either redirects to download of file or of folder when given a uuid
- Merge the rendering folders and the handler folders together, that way the handler and what it renders is all together
- Find a better way to do mod.rs for handlers, not nice that I cannot search for the handler file name.
- Cleanup filetools, probably don't need these splitup into different files
- Param map probably needs its own module
