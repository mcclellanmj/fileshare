- Need to move the database stuff out to another module to prevent main from getting too big
- Make function that either redirects to download of file or of folder when given a uuid
- Merge the rendering folders and the handler folders together, that way the handler and what it renders is all together
- Cleanup filetools, probably don't need these splitup into different files
- Make function to get a single param of name from the param_map... maybe may param map a struct?
- Start making some tests
