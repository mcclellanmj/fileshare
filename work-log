-- Fix issue where it will not download when traversing down
-- Fix issue where it automatically goes to the root of the share instead of showing an error when someone tries to manipulate
   the filepath to something not in the share
- Merge the rendering folders and the handler folders together, that way the handler and what it renders is all together
- Cleanup filetools, probably don't need these splitup into different files
- Start making some tests
- Find out if the Params function can be made to use &str instead of String
