- De-spaghetti the code base
- Fix up the share window
  - Add number of days to share behavior
    - This is probably not necessary, just always expire in 7 days
- Intercept the back button push and if a prompt is active close it and don't do the back
  - There's no intercepting this, likely need to get creative with the paths
- Add an upload function
- Investigate putting Files into a new Module, like FolderView which has its own set of messages
- It'd be nice if the Loading text had a delay
  - It'd be even nicer if it was centered
    - And it'd be even more nicer if it was a progress bar
- Add the windows for sharing and menus
- Make the title bar stick to the top
- Can we animate parts of this?
  - First thing that comes to mind is animate the loading bar to give it a gradual fade in, it feels jarring right now
